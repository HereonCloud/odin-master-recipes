        <p>Methods</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Place the rice in a sieve. Rinse under cold running water, to remove
            any excess starch, until water runs clear. Place the rice and water
            in a large saucepan, covered, over high heat. Bring to the boil.
            Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, for 12 minutes or until all
            the water is absorbed. Remove from heat. Set aside, covered, for 10
            minutes to cool slightly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine the vinegar, sugar and salt in a small bowl. Transfer the
            rice to a large glass bowl. Use a wooden paddle to break up rice
            lumps while gradually adding the vinegar mixture, gently folding to
            combine. Continue folding and fanning the rice for 15 minutes or
            until rice is cool.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place a sushi mat on a clean surface with slats running
            horizontally. Place a nori sheet, shiny-side down, on the mat. Use
            wet hands to spread one-sixth of the rice over the nori sheet,
            leaving a 3cm-wide border along the edge furthest away from you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place salmon and avocado along the centre of the rice. Hold filling
            in place while rolling the mat over to enclose rice and filling.
            Repeat with remaining nori, rice, salmon and avocado.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a sharp knife to slice sushi widthways into 1.5cm-thick slices.
            Place on serving dishes with soy sauce, wasabi and pickled ginger,
            if desired.
